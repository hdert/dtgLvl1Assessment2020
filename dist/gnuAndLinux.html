              From
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>
              “Linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems
              based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first
              released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is
              typically packaged in a Linux distribution.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="col-12">
            In 1991 Linus Torvalds, a computer science student at the University
            of Helsinki purchased a computer for his personal use that came with
            a copy of MS-DOS the precursor to the Windows operating system made
            by Microsoft. Torvalds wasn’t satisfied with MS-DOS and wanted to
            use a Unix operating system like he was accustomed to at the
            university. But when Torvalds tried to obtain a copy and license of
            Unix he found that the cheapest version of Unix cost $5000USD. And
            so he started a project that eventually turned into a full kernel,
            the Linux kernel.
          </p>

          <p class="col-12">
            Later the same year on the 25th of August he announced the system on
            Usenet a precursor of sorts to the bulletin board system and
            internet forums or message boards, posting his message to the
            newsgroup ‘comp.os.minix’.

            <p>"Hello everybody out there using minix -</p>
            <p>
              I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big
              and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been
              brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any
              feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS
              resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system
              (due to practical reasons) among other things).
            </p>
            <p>
              I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to
              work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few
              months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want.
              Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement
              them :-)
            </p>
            <p>Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)</p>
            <p>
              PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded
              fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it
              probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as
              that's all I have :-(.

          <p class="col-12">
            But if Torvalds couldn’t attain a copy of Unix and he wasn’t running
            MS-DOS on his computer, then what was he running and what OS did he
            use to write Linux and why didn’t he just use this OS for his own
            personal use? The answer to this is MINIX, an OS made by Andrew
            Tanenbaum in 1987 for educational use. This meant that the source
            code was available for seeing how certain things work in the OS, say
            for example a class on OS fundamentals. But this also meant that you
            weren’t allowed to change and redistribute the OS. In addition the
            OS didn’t quite take advantage of the features of Torvald’s
            computer. But the biggest problem with MINIX was that in being
            educational Tanenbaum didn’t actively develop the OS and didn’t want
            to do anything further with the OS.
          </p>

          <p class="col-12">
            But that still doesn’t fully answer the question, why didn’t he just
            use MINIX for his own personal use? To answer this we have go back
            to 1983, the start of the development of GNU’s not Unix! (GNU). The
            GNU Project was started by Richard Stallman and he announced the
            project in 1983 on September the 27th to the newsgroups
            net.unix-wizards and net.usoft. Development on the project began on
            January the 5th, 1984 after Stallman had quit his job to allow him
            to be free of any ownership disputes from his employer.
          </p>

          <p class="col-8">
            Even though the fact that GNU’s not Unix is highlighted by the
            recursive acronym of the project one of it’s goals is to be a
            Unix-like system because of its popularity and because Unix was
            modular so each piece could be worked on individually. This along
            with GNU being partly written in C meant that certain utilities like
            the TeX typesetting system and the X Window System could be ported
            to GNU and wouldn’t have to be written from scratch. As time
            progressed GNU’s development was getting more and more complete,
            apart from the kernel called GNU Hurd whose development had lagged
            behind the rest of GNU.
