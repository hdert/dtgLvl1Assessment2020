            From Wikipedia: “Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser
            computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix,
            development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center
            by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.”
          </p>

          <p class="col-8">
            But what does this all mean, well in the late 1960’s development was
            underway on Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service)
            an operating system with many new and novel ideas. One of these
            ideas was time-sharing, the ability to share computer resources
            amongst many users at the same time. Bell Labs, MIT, and General
            Electric were all involved in the project but Bell Labs dissatisfied
            with the progress of the project started withdrawing from it. This
            left just a few researchers from Bell Labs working on Multics one of
            them being Ken Thompson.

          <p class="col-12">
            With Bell Labs withdrawing from Multics he decided to write his own
            operating system (OS) with some of the ideas from the Multics
            project. While he still had access to Multics he wrote various
            things for his OS including a game called Space Travel. But writing
            Space Travel made him realize that he needed a better computer for
            his purposes and he found a little-used Digital Equipment
            Corporation PDP-7 at Bell Labs.
          </p>

          <p class="col-8">
            At this point there was a team of researchers working on Unix led by
            Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie and they implemented various
            features on Unix based on the improvements from Multics but
            simplified. It was around this time that Thompson created the B
            programming language and the first version of the name was thought
            up, Uniplexed Information and Computing Service (Unics). A few
            different departments of Bell Labs were interested in the OS but
            they wanted to run it on a larger computer and another department
            wanted to do text processing on it so the team added text processing
            features to the OS and received funding to get a PDP-11/20. It was
            also around then that the OS was officially named Unix. Most
            programs in Unix were at the time written in a programming language
            called Assembly, the problem with Assembly was that it was very low
            level meaning that the code was complex and hard for a human to
            process, but this problem gets solved later.

          <p class="col-12">
            The system was getting more and more complex and the need for some
            sort of guide or manual to the OS grew, so one was made and dubbed
            the ‘UNIX Programmer’s Manual’. Each command or program in the
            system was documented in a ‘man page’ a format that to this day is
            widely used on Linux to document commands/programs. Each man page
            offered a terse reference of information about the usage of the
            program as well as listing known bugs and giving contact details for
            the maintainer/maker of the command/program so further questions
            could be asked and the answers could be delivered and added to the
            man page.

          <p class="col-12">
            Cut to 1973, Unix is getting very popular at Bell Labs but the
            aforementioned problem of the whole OS being written in Assembly is
            still there, it was the widely accepted opinion at the time that due
            to an OS being so complex it had to be written in a low-level
            language like Assembly. The aforementioned B programming language
            isn’t the ideal contender as it is slow and not very powerful, but
            in the meantime Ritchie had been working on and improving B which
            resulted in the successor C which was faster and more powerful. The
            decision was made to port Unix to C.

          <h3 class="col-12">Where is it now?</h3>

          <p class="col-12">
            In the modern day Unix is split into a few different versions, Unix
            has been mostly taken over in popularity by Linux, more on that
            later and there are the BSD’s: FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. Each of
            these BSDs have their own strengths and weaknesses but by far the
            most popular Unix derivative is an operating system you might’ve
            heard of, MacOS. Apart from MacOS Unix derivative systems have a
            negligible market share.
